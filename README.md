# C-Compiler-Project
The C-Compiler-Project is a Java-based compiler equipped with a lexical analyzer and syntax analyzer, tailored specifically to process programs written in the C programming language. Leveraging the versatility of Java, this compiler offers developers a reliable tool for analyzing and understanding the structure of C source code. The lexical analyzer efficiently breaks down the input code into tokens, while the syntax analyzer validates the arrangement of these tokens according to the rules of C syntax. With a focus on these foundational components, the C-Compiler-Project provides a solid framework for further development and customization, making it an ideal choice for projects requiring precise lexical and syntactic analysis of C programs.
